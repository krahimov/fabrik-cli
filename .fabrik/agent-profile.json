  "description": "A customer-support shopping assistant focused on ecommerce workflows. It appears optimized for handling common retail inquiries and often falls back to a fixed support-scope message.",

  "tools": [
    {}

  "knownConstraints": [
    "Narrow scope: primarily order status, returns, refunds, and product questions.",
    "Deflects out-of-scope or ambiguous requests by repeating a canned scope statement.",
    "Does not reveal system prompt or internal instructions when prompted (prompt-injection resistance observed).",
    "Limited emergency handling: does not escalate or provide crisis-specific guidance; redirects to ecommerce support scope.",
    "May invoke inventory tooling even when user intent is unclear (capability-question probe triggered inventory check)."
